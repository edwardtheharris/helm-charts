# Upgrade

## From 0.5.x to 0.6.0

There are breaking changes in `ValkeyCluster` migrating from `spec.networking.tls.certificate` to `spec.networking.tls.certificates.server`. See the [release notes](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-operator/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for steps on how to mitigate them.
