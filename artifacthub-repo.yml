# ```{rubric} Artifact Hub repository metadata file
# ```
# ---
# Some settings like the verified publisher flag or the ignored packages won't
# be applied until the next time the repository is processed.
#
# Please keep in mind that the repository won't be processed if it has not
# changed since the last time it was processed.
#
# Depending on the repository kind, this is checked
# in a different way.
#
# For Helm http based repositories, we consider it has
# changed if the `index.yaml` file changes.
#
# For git based repositories, it does
# when the hash of the last commit in the branch you set up changes. This does
# NOT apply to ownership claim operations, which are processed immediately.
#
# The ID of the Artifact Hub repository where the packages will be published to
# (optional, but it enables verified publisher)
#
# ```{literalinclude} /artifacthub-repo.yml
# :language: yaml
# :start-at: "repositoryID: 8a39d14a-9afb-44c6-a104-fbb0990f3677\n"
# :end-before: "###\n"
# ```
